# Video 3 - Static Vs Dynamic Memory - 2

## My_Notes:
```
* Heap Memory - Developers Given Resourse is Heap Memory | If need Memory take from Heap Memory

* Dynamic Memory - It Gets Memory when Program is in Running State
    In Pointer in C, *P has 2 bytes |2bytes are Fixed & Static and size is based on complier
    Pointer store Only Address
    16 bit complier's *P Pointer size = 2 Bytes
    32 bit complier's *P Pointer size = 4 Bytes
    64 bit complier's *P Pointer size = 8 Bytes

    Refer Image

    malloc - Mememory Allocation
    free(p) - Deallocates Mememory of Pointer P
