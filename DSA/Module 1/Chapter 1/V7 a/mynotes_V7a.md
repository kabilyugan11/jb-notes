# Video 7a - How Logarithm Works ? (Understand Deeply)

## My_Notes:
```
* About How Log Works
    2² = 4 | 2ˣ = 4
    In here, 2 is Base Form, 
             Power 2 or x is Growth Rate And 
             4 is Finale Answer

    log₂ Finale Ans = Growth Rate
    In here, ₂ is Base Form

    2² = 4
    2ˣ = 4
    x = log₂4
