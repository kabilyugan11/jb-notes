```
* About Hashing
    Hash set - To find just index is avialble
    Hash Map - After finded index and store value for each index

    Check -> frequencyCount.java,

LeetCode Questions Covered in the Video

This video explores hashing fundamentals and introduces problem-solving techniques. Understanding how to efficiently count frequencies of elements using hash maps. Here are the problems discussed:

**Basic Hashing Operations**

1.  **Frequency Count**
    
    -   **Name:** Count Elements with Maximum Frequency
        
    -   **Objective:** Find the element that appears most frequently in an array.
        
    -   **Approach:**
        
        -   Use a hash map to store the frequency of each element and determine which element has the maximum frequency.
            
    -   **Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/description/")
        
2.  **Intersection of Two Arrays**
    
    -   **Name:** Intersection of Two Arrays II
        
    -   **Objective:** Find the intersection of two arrays, considering duplicates based on the frequency of each element.
        
    -   **Approach:**
        
        -   Use hash maps to count the frequency of each element in both arrays and identify common elements based on the frequency.
            
    -   **Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/description/")
        

3.  **Replicating Substring**
    
    -   **Name :** Repeated Substring Pattern
        
        -   **Objective:** Check if a string can be formed by repeating a substring.
            
        -   **Approach:**
            
            -   Use hashing or string manipulation techniques to verify if the string is composed of repeated substrings.
                
        -   **Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/description/")
            
    -   **Name :** Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
        
        -   **Objective:** Find the longest substring where each character appears at least K times.
            
        -   **Approach:**
            
            -   Use a frequency counter (hash map) to track character counts and ensure that the substring has characters repeating at least K times.
                
        -   **Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/description/")
