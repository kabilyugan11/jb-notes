# Video 2 - Static Vs Dynamic Memory - 1

## My_Notes:
```
* DSA - Data Stored Efficiently during the Execution of a Program in Main Memory

* Main memory Structure:
    Logical Representaion
        1 Register = 1 Byte
        Starts from 0 to 65535 | 65536 Bytes = 64 * 1024 Bytes | 1024 Bytes is 1KB ,So 64 * 1KB = 64KB 
        1 Segment = 64 KB
        Ram has 6GB Memory but Not fully to Use and Splits Into Multiple Segments for Use

* About Static Memory:
    Refer Images

    Main Memory
        Heap
        Stack --> Stack Frame (SF) or Activation Record (SF1) (Main variables load) -> (SF2) f1 (f1 variables load) -> (SF3) f2 (f2 variables load)
        Code Section

    Stack means Last in First Out

    It is based on Complier Time 
    So its called as Compiler Time Memory or Static Memory or Stack Memory
