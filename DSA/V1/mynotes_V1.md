# Video 1 - DSA Intro Lecture

## My_Notes:
```
* About Data Structures:
    - Organizing the data effeicinetly and Doing the execution of Program in Main Memeory (Temporary Memeory OR RAM) 
    - Main Memory has Program File and Data File

* Database:
    - Large amount of data stored in Permanent Storage
    - In table wise and Relationally Stored

* Database Warehouse:
    - Google generate millions of data everyday and that grows
    - It stores array of Multiple DBs
    - Leagcy Data (History of data) and Operational data

* Big Data:
    - It mines data from millions of data
    - Big data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that require advanced tools and techniques to store, process, and analyze for insights.

* DS Topics:
    Array, Matrics, Linked lists -> Physical DS (Determine how to store in physically in memeory) 

    Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, Hasing -> Logical DS (Apply logics on Top of physical)

    Recursion:
        Using it in small only in Coding/Programming
        Its used in Problem Solving
        It's a Mathematicl approch to solve problem
        In Interview -> Its Shows you a Unique for Your Problem Solving 

    Sorting:
         Arranging data in a specific order
